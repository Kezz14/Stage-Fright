Created for the 2025 BPA Website Design Team competition.

As aspiring programmers, we are thrilled to showcase the website we created for Stage Fright, a local rock band. Every line of code—almost 5,000 in total—was written by our team, 
giving us hands-on experience with web development. This project has been an invaluable learning opportunity, allowing us to apply and expand our programming skills in real-world 
scenarios. From responsive design to coding best practices, we’ve gained a deeper understanding of the development process and are excited to continue growing as developers.

Welcome to Stage Fright!
